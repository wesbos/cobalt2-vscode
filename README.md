## Contributing

To work on the theme:

1. Clone this repo and open in VS Code
2. Open run `View → Run`
3. Click `Launch Extension`. This will open up another VS Code Editor
4. Make changes to `cobalt2.json`. You will see changes reflected in the other editor that opened in step 3.

If you are making a Pull Request, Please give me a screenshot of before/after!

## Deploying a new version

These are mostly notes for me.

1. Increment the version number in `package.json` with `npm version major|minor|patch`
1. run `npm run bundle`
1. run `npm run publish`

## I don't like something

You don't need to fork it!

First, this theme is new so if something is funky, please open an issue. There are many languages and parts of VS Code I don't use, so let me know!

These are the things we have control over. If you would like to change something, you can either open a PR and see if I'd like it added, or override the colours in your own settings.json file.
